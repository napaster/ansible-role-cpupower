# ansible-cpupower

Linux kernel tool to tune CPU power saving related features

## Requirements

* Ansible 3.0.0+
* Debian uses the `linux-cpupower` package. Because Debian 13 does not ship a
  cpupower systemd service, this role deploys one to `/etc/systemd/system`.

## Example configuration

```yaml
---
cpupower:
# Enable cpupower service or not
  - enable: 'true'
# Restart cpupower service after deploy or not
    restart: 'true'
# Install cpupower package or not
    install_package: 'true'
# 'present' (do nothing if package is already installed) or 'latest' (always
# upgrade to last version)
    package_state: 'latest'
    settings:
# Valid governors: ondemand, performance, powersave, conservative, userspace
    - governor: 'performance'
      min_freq: '2.25GHz'
      max_freq: '3GHz'
```
